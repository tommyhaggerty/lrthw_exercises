# Intro Chapter

Questions:

> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

  A: Reading and Writing, Attention to Detail, Spotting differences

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

  Reading and Writing is being able to read, write, and type effectively.
  
  Attention to detail is helpful initially when writing code to ensure that you 
  write it as complete and well as possible, and also effective with the 3rd skill.
  
  Spotting Differences is important particularly with this book as it will help 
  you figure out why your code doesn't work when it should. This is where attention
  to detail comes in again. Having a good attention to detail will help you more
  quickly spot the differences.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

  You should not copy and paste as you will need to learn to write code, not just
  copy code. Practice makes perfect they say so more time typing code will train
  your brain to type code better and more completely without relying on it already
  being typed by someone else.

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

  Practice and persistence are what will train your brain to be a good coder. If you 
  don't practice you will never get better at coding, if you aren't persistent then 
  you will likely give up when it gets hard, which will be all the time as you don't
  know anything yet.
