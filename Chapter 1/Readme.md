> What was done in this exercise?

I used puts to add an additional line in the code.

Puts prints a line of code to the terminal.

I also used the octothorpe char # which comments out a line of code.
This allows it to be in the code but not execute in the terminal.

###Rubocop errors
Rubocop did not want me to use the double quotes so I swapped them with the single quotes.
I also used the escape \ on the internal quotes of the lines. 
The last error I had was that there was a blank line at the end. I removed that blank line.
